## Task to be completed
We would like you to clone this repository and amend the home page to display a list of Cards with the launches data retrieved from the spacex data API. You may take as long as you require to complete the solution to demonstrate your knowledge in creating a web application, however, we ideally would like this returned within 3 days.

Please consider the structure of your code and develop as if you were working in a commercial team environment and test the solution as you see fit.

The restful api that we would like you to use is https://api.spacexdata.com/v5/

You can find docs for this API here: https://github.com/r-spacex/SpaceX-API/tree/master/docs#rspacex-api-docs

Your solution should cover the following tasks:
- Make API request(s) on page load
- Display data top 10 items
- Provide some test coverage for your project

The data that we would like you to display are:
- `name`
- `date_utc`
- The first core serial/name from `cores`
- `id` and `type` from payloads
- display the image from `links.patch.small` in links
- use `success` and `failures` to show the user the success/failure of launch and reason of failure.
